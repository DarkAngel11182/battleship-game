Game Rules
Battleship is a two-player strategy game where the objective is to sink the opponent's fleet before they sink yours. 

Here are the basic rules:

Each player has a fleet of ships of various lengths.
Players take turns to attack a position on the opponent's grid.
If the attack hits an enemy ship, it's a "hit," and the player gets another turn.
If the attack misses, it's a "miss," and the turn passes to the opponent.
The game continues until all ships of one player are sunk.
The player who sinks all opponent's ships wins the game.
